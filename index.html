    <h1>What our students say</h1>
    <p>Nice building to walk past and take pictures. It is located in a nice square so worth doing if you are nearby Mother Teresa Square.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="testimonial-col">
            <img src="images/user3.jpg">
        <div>
            <p>It is a interesting place to visit especially the Mother Theresa Square where one can see an interesting mixture of Italian Fascist and Communist architecture superimposed on each other. It reflects over 70 years of a very complex history.</p>
