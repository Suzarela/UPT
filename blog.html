            <h1>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2023</h1>
            <p>All engineering and surveying academic programs meet the requirements so that graduates can apply for the fundamentals of engineering examination within any state of the United States and its territories. ABET does the verification, trained evaluators review and accredit programs in their respective disciplines and are members of professional associations at the national level.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In these last 10 years more than 90% of our students completed at least two internships before graduating, an achievement that allows them to have a job offer upon graduation. Our graduates are working in and outside of Tirana</p>
            <br>
            <p>A graduate of the industrial engineering career applies his/her skills and knowledge to increase operational efficiency in any type of business (healthcare, manufacturing, distribution / logistics and services of all kinds), reduce costs, and innovate work systems, as well as reduce the impact that work systems could have on the environment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We are committed to offering each of our students an education that prepares them to be an innovative professional, problem-solving oriented, ethical, and committed to continuing their learning. Our students participate in research as well as student activities through student organizations such as IISE (Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineering), national and international conferences, among others that help them develop their skills in leadership and entrepreneurship.</p>
